committed to Node.js may be in a position to pay for a 
conference ticket.
<br><br>
With this in mind, I’m delighted to announce the NodeConf 
London scholarship. This scholarship makes available a number 
of tickets at no cost.
</p><h4>Eligibility</h4><p>The scholarship is available to anyone not normally able to 
attend a conference. If that might be you (even if you’re not 
in one of the groups below) then please apply.
<br><br>
Some of the groups we are especially keen to support include:
</p><ul><li>LGBTQIA+</li><li>Ethnic minorities</li><li>Women</li><li>Disabled people</li><li>Charity workers</li><li>Educational workers and students</li></ul><h4>Applying</h4><p>Applying for a scholarship ticket is super simple. Send a 
short email to <a href='mailto:ian.crowther@nearform.com?subject=NodeConf London Scholarship'>ian.crowther@nearform.com</a> 
using the title <em>"NodeConf London Scholarship"</em>.
<br><br>
In your email, please include:
</p><ul><li>A bit about who you are.</li><li>Some info on what you do.</li><li>A few words detailing why you would like the scholarship.</li></ul><p>Please note,
<br>
Successful applicants will get a single standard conference ticket.
<br><br>
All emails will be treated in the strictest confidence, we will not announce who the scholarships go to but you’re welcome to say so yourself.
We are only able to cover the cost of the conference ticket so please consider your travel costs before applying.
Many thanks to Simon McManus and the EnhanceConf team for the inspiration for this post.
